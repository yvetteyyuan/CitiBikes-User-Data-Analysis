# Santander-Cycles-User-Data-Analysis

This repo's analysis is based on the London public bike share dataset, accessed through GCP's BigQuery. 

Customers frequently complain about bike stations being empty. I analyzed real-time rider data to answer the following business questions through SQL and made suggestions about how to improve the service quality of bike sharing systems in London.

- Find traces of empty stations.
- How big is this problem?
- What are the most popular stations in the network?
- When does their usage peak?
- What are the most popular trips in the network?
- Are there differences in the types of rides that people take?
- Is there a pattern in the types of stations that are empty?
